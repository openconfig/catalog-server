### How to grant accounts with access to different organizations

+ First, please ensure that your catalog server is running on GCP correctly, refer to [deploy.md](deploy.md) for more details.
+ Enable identity platform on GCP following this [instruction](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/quickstart-email-password). It also gives instruction on how to sign in users with email and password, but it's also doable to use other signing in methods supported by identity platform, including signing in using Google account, LinkedIn account.
+ Replace the boilerplate codes in [update.html](../frontend/static/update.html) from `line 19` to `line 28` with that from your identity platform. See this [instruction](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/quickstart-email-password) for more details.
+ See [scripts/admin](../scripts/admin) directory for details on how to grant access to different accounts.
+ Note that currently the permissions are specific to DB name. So if you use two DBs with the same name in two DB instances, one account would have access to both DBs. Therefore, it's recommended to use just a single SQL instance to manage all of the DBs between the different catalog servers.
